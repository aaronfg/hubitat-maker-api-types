# Interface: CapabilityAttributes

This awful interface is for an object that describes
the Attributes associated with a Capability.

It is returned in the `getDeviceInfo()` endpoint
in the `capabilities` array.

It's insanity that this array is either a string--the
name of the capability--or it's an object like the one
described in this interface.

Of course the name of the attribute is lowercase here, but
is Capital case in the capabilities array... ðŸ¤¬

Parsing it is gross, but it is what it is.
